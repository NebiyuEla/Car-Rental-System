# Car-Rental-System

This is a basic Car Rental System created using C++. The program lets users see available 
cars, rent a car, and return a car using a simple menu that appears in the terminal/console.
It is made to practice and show understanding of C++ basics like structs, arrays, loops, if
statements, and functions.
